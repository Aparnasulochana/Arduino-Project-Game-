# Arduino-Project-Game-
An Arduino project to detect button states and Serial Communication.
**Overview**
This project demonstrates how to use an Arduino to detect the state of a button using the INPUT_PULLUP mode. The button's state (pressed or not pressed) is displayed in the Serial Monitor, making it easy to visualize the button's behavior.

**Features**
Uses the INPUT_PULLUP mode to simplify button wiring by avoiding external pull-up resistors.
Detects button press and button release states.
Communicates button states to a connected computer via Serial Communication.

**Components Required**
Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano, Mega, etc.)
Push button
Jumper wires
Breadboard

**Circuit Diagram**
Connect one terminal of the push button to a digital pin (e.g., pin 2) on the Arduino.
Connect the other terminal of the button to GND.
No external pull-up resistor is needed as we use the internal pull-up feature of Arduino.

**How It Works**
The button is connected to GND, and the Arduino's internal pull-up resistor keeps the pin HIGH when the button is not pressed.
When the button is pressed, the pin is pulled to LOW (GND), which the Arduino detects as a button press.
The Arduino sends the current state of the button (pressed or released) to the Serial Monitor.
Set up the circuit as described in the Circuit Diagram section.
Upload the provided code to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE.
Press and release the button to see the state updates in the Serial Monitor.

**Applications**
Games and interactive systems using button inputs.
Debugging and testing button functionality in Arduino projects.
Prototyping user input systems for embedded devices.
